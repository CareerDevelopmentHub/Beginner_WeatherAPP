Follow these steps to get your own API key (APPID) from OpenWeatherMap:

1. Go to the OpenWeatherMap website.
2. Click on the 'Sign Up' button on the top right corner of the page.
3. Fill in your details and click on 'Create Account'.
4. After you've created your account, go to the 'API Keys' tab.
